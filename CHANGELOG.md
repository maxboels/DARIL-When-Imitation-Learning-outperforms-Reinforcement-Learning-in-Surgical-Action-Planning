# Changelog

All notable changes to the DARIL repository structure and codebase.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-23

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Repository Reorganization

Complete restructuring of the repository for improved navigation and maintainability.

#### Changed
- **Reduced root-level items from 33 to 12** for cleaner organization
- Consolidated scattered files into logical directory grouping

#### Added
- `configs/` - Centralized configuration files (moved from root)
- `scripts/` - All executable scripts in one place
- `src/` - Core source code with clear module separation
  - `src/training/` - Training implementations
  - `src/evaluation/` - Evaluation framework
  - `src/models/` - Model architectures
  - `src/environment/` - RL environments
  - `src/utils/` - Utility functions
  - `src/debugging/` - Debug tools
- `notebooks/` - Interactive visualizations and demos
- `docs/` - All documentation in one place
  - `docs/paper_manuscript/` - LaTeX paper source
  - `docs/paper_notes/` - Research notes
  - `docs/paper_generation/` - Figure generation scripts
- `outputs/` - Unified output directory
  - `outputs/results/` - Evaluation results
  - `outputs/models_saved/` - Model checkpoints
  - `outputs/logs/` - Training logs
  - `outputs/figures/` - Generated figures
  - `outputs/data/` - Processed datasets
- `STRUCTURE.md` - Comprehensive repository documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

#### Removed
- `api/` folder (HTML files moved to `notebooks/`)
- `web_app/` folder (HTML files moved to `notebooks/`)
- `__pycache__/` directories (added to .gitignore)
- Redundant root-level `.yaml`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.txt` files (moved to appropriate folders)

#### Migrated
- All config files (`*.yaml`) â†’ `configs/`
- All scripts (`*.py`, `*.sh`, `*.txt`) â†’ `scripts/`
- Source folders (`training/`, `evaluation/`, `models/`, `environment/`, `utils/`, `debugging/`) â†’ `src/`
- Visualization files and folders â†’ `notebooks/`
- Documentation folders (`paper_manuscript/`, `paper_notes/`, `paper_generation/`) â†’ `docs/`
- Output folders (`results/`, `logs/`, `figures/`, `models_saved/`, `enhanced_data/`, `datasets/`) â†’ `outputs/`

#### Updated
- `README.md` - Added repository structure section with clear navigation
- `.gitignore` - Updated patterns to reflect new structure
- All documentation now references correct paths

### Benefits
âœ… **Clearer navigation** - Logical grouping makes it easy to find files  
âœ… **Better maintainability** - Related code is co-located  
âœ… **Improved onboarding** - New contributors can understand structure quickly  
âœ… **Cleaner root** - Only essential files at top level  
âœ… **Standard conventions** - Follows common Python project patterns
