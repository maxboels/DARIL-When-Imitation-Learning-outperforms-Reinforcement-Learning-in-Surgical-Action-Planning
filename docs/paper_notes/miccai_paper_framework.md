# When Imitation Learning Outperforms Reinforcement Learning in Surgical Action Planning: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Abstract Framework

**Background**: Surgical action planning requires learning from expert demonstrations while ensuring safe and effective decision-making. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in various domains, its effectiveness compared to imitation learning (IL) in surgical contexts remains unclear.

**Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL approaches for surgical action planning on the CholecT50 dataset. Our baseline autoregressive transformer achieves strong performance through expert demonstration learning. We systematically evaluated: (1) standard IL with causal prediction, (2) RL with learned rewards via inverse RL, and (3) world model-based RL with forward simulation.

**Results**: Our IL baseline achieves 45.6% current action mAP and 44.9% next action mAP with graceful planning degradation (47.1% at 1s to 29.1% at 10s). Surprisingly, sophisticated RL approaches failed to improve upon this baseline, achieving comparable or slightly worse performance.

**Conclusion**: In surgical domains with expert demonstrations, well-optimized imitation learning can outperform complex RL approaches. This challenges the assumption that RL universally improves upon IL and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

### Results

#### Main Finding: IL Baseline Superiority
| Method | Current mAP | Next mAP | Planning 1s | Planning 10s |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **IL Baseline** | **45.6%** | **44.9%** | **47.1%** | **29.1%** |
| IRL Enhanced | 44.2% | 43.8% | 45.3% | 28.7% |
| World Model RL | 42.1% | 41.6% | 43.8% | 27.2% |
| Direct Video RL | 43.9% | 43.1% | 44.9% | 28.1% |

#### Key Insights from Analysis

**1. Planning Degradation Patterns**
- Graceful degradation: 47.1% → 29.1% (1s → 10s)
- Instrument component most robust (21.3% loss)
- Target component shows steepest decline
- Consistent patterns across surgical phases

**2. Why RL Underperformed**
- Expert demonstrations already optimal for test metrics
- RL exploration discovers valid but suboptimal paths
- Test set similarity to training data favors direct imitation
- Surgical domain constraints limit beneficial exploration

**3. Component-Level Analysis**
- **Instruments (I)**: 90.3% → 69.5% (most stable)
- **Verbs (V)**: 68.1% → 43.1% (moderate decline)  
- **Targets (T)**: 57.1% → 23.5% (steepest decline)
- **Combinations**: Show expected multiplicative effects

### Discussion

#### When IL Excels Over RL
1. **Expert-Optimal Demonstrations**: When training data represents near-optimal behavior
2. **Evaluation Metric Alignment**: When test metrics match training objectives
3. **Limited Exploration Benefits**: When domain constraints restrict beneficial exploration
4. **Data Sufficiency**: When sufficient expert demonstrations are available

#### Implications for Surgical AI
1. **Resource Allocation**: Focus optimization on IL rather than complex RL
2. **Safety Considerations**: IL inherently safer by staying close to expert behavior
3. **Deployment Readiness**: Simpler models easier to validate and deploy
4. **Domain-Specific Design**: Surgical AI may require different approaches than general RL

#### Limitations and Future Work
1. **Single Dataset**: Results specific to CholecT50 laparoscopic surgery
2. **Expert Test Set**: Results may differ with sub-expert evaluation data
3. **Metric Alignment**: Other evaluation criteria might favor RL approaches
4. **Exploration Strategies**: More sophisticated exploration might benefit RL

### Conclusion

This work provides crucial insights for surgical AI development by demonstrating that sophisticated RL approaches do not universally improve upon well-optimized imitation learning. In surgical domains with expert demonstrations and aligned evaluation metrics, simple IL can outperform complex RL methods. This challenges common assumptions about ML method hierarchy and provides practical guidance for surgical AI research resource allocation.

**Key Takeaway**: "Don't fix what isn't broken" - when IL performs well on expert data, additional complexity may not yield benefits and could introduce unnecessary risks in safety-critical applications.
