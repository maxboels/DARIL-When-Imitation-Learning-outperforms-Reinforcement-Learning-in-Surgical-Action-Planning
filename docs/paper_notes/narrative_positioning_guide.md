## üìù Key Messaging Framework

### Primary Message
**"In surgical domains with expert demonstrations, well-optimized imitation learning can outperform complex reinforcement learning approaches"**

### Supporting Messages
1. **Methodological Rigor**: First systematic comparison of IL vs RL for surgical planning
2. **Important Insights**: Understanding when complexity doesn't help
3. **Practical Value**: Resource allocation guidance for surgical AI research

## üîÑ Reframing "Negative Results" as Positive Contributions

### ‚ùå Avoid These Framings:
- "RL failed to improve upon IL"
- "Our methods didn't work"
- "We couldn't beat the baseline"
- "The experiments were unsuccessful"

### ‚úÖ Use These Framings Instead:
- "IL demonstrates robust performance that sophisticated RL approaches cannot improve upon"
- "Our systematic evaluation reveals conditions where IL excels over RL"
- "We identify key factors that determine when complex methods provide benefits"
- "This comprehensive analysis provides crucial insights for method selection"

## üìä Results Presentation Strategy

### Frame Your Numbers Positively

**Your Actual Results:**
- IL Baseline: 45.6% current mAP, 44.9% next mAP
- Planning: 47.1% (1s) ‚Üí 29.1% (10s)
- RL methods: Slightly lower performance

**Positive Framing:**
```
"Our optimized IL baseline achieves strong performance with 45.6% current action 
mAP and 44.9% next action mAP, demonstrating graceful degradation from 47.1% 
at 1-second planning to 29.1% at 10-second planning. Comprehensive evaluation 
of sophisticated RL approaches reveals that this performance represents a 
challenging benchmark that complex methods cannot improve upon."
```

### Component Analysis as Strength
```
"Component-wise analysis reveals robust performance across all surgical action 
components: Instruments (90.3%), Verbs (68.1%), and Targets (57.1%), with 
combination components showing expected multiplicative relationships."
```
