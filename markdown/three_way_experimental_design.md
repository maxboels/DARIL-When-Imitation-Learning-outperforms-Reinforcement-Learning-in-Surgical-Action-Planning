# Three-Way Experimental Comparison Design

## 🎯 Research Question
**Does using a latent world model as an RL simulator improve performance compared to direct RL training?**

## 🧪 Experimental Setup: Three Approaches

### Method 1: Imitation Learning (Baseline)
```python
# Training: Supervised learning on expert demonstrations
world_model = DualWorldModel(...)
train_supervised(world_model, expert_demonstrations)

# Evaluation: Direct action prediction
predictions = world_model.predict_actions(test_states)
mAP = evaluate_action_prediction(predictions, expert_actions)
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Direct learning from expert demonstrations
- ✅ Supervised training objective
- ❌ No exploration or policy improvement

### Method 2: RL with World Model Simulation (Our Main Approach)
```python
# Phase 1: Train world model (same as Method 1)
world_model = train_supervised_world_model(expert_demonstrations)

# Phase 2: Use world model as RL environment
env = WorldModelEnvironment(world_model)  # Uses world_model.rl_state_prediction()
agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", env)
agent.learn(timesteps=50000)

# Evaluation: Policy performance in simulated environment
rewards = evaluate_policy(agent, env)
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Model-based RL with learned dynamics
- ✅ Can explore beyond expert demonstrations  
- ✅ Leverages world model for planning
- ❌ Limited by world model accuracy

### Method 3: RL without World Model (Ablation Study)
```python
# Training: Direct RL on video sequences
env = DirectVideoEnvironment(video_data)  # Steps through actual frames
agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", env)
agent.learn(timesteps=50000)

# Evaluation: Policy performance on real sequences
rewards = evaluate_policy(agent, env)
```

**Key Characteristics:**
- ✅ Model-free RL
- ✅ Direct interaction with real data
- ❌ No simulation or planning capability
- ❌ Limited to existing video sequences

## 📊 Evaluation Framework

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Method 1 (IL) | Method 2 (RL+WM) | Method 3 (RL Direct) |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Action Prediction** | ✅ mAP, Top-K | ✅ Action similarity | ✅ Action similarity |
| **Sequential Planning** | ❌ N/A | ✅ Episode rewards | ✅ Episode rewards |
| **Exploration Capability** | ❌ None | ✅ World model limited | ✅ Data limited |
| **Sample Efficiency** | ✅ Direct supervision | ❓ Depends on WM quality | ❌ Requires many episodes |
| **Generalization** | ❌ Limited to training dist. | ✅ Can simulate new scenarios | ❌ Limited to video data |

### Research Hypotheses

**H1: World Model Advantage**
> RL with world model (Method 2) will outperform direct RL (Method 3) because:
> - Better sample efficiency through simulation
> - Ability to plan ahead using learned dynamics
> - More stable training through model-based updates

**H2: RL vs IL Trade-offs**
> Methods 2&3 will show different strengths vs IL (Method 1):
> - Lower action similarity but better sequential decision-making
> - Potential for discovering novel effective strategies
> - Better adaptation to dynamic scenarios

**H3: World Model Quality Impact**
> Performance gap between Methods 2&3 will correlate with world model accuracy:
> - Better world models → larger advantage for Method 2
> - Poor world models → Method 3 may outperform Method 2

## 🔬 Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Data Preparation
```python
# Split CholecT50 dataset
train_videos = load_cholect50_data(split='train', max_videos=20)
test_videos = load_cholect50_data(split='test', max_videos=10)

# Ensure consistent evaluation
random.seed(42)
np.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(42)
```

### Phase 2: Method 1 - Imitation Learning
```python
def run_il_baseline():
    # Train world model in supervised mode
    world_model = DualWorldModel(...)
    il_trainer = ILTrainer(world_model, config)
    model_path = il_trainer.train(train_videos)
    
    # Evaluate action prediction
    evaluator = ActionEvaluator()
    il_results = evaluator.evaluate_il(model_path, test_videos)
    
    return il_results
```

### Phase 3: Method 2 - RL with World Model
```python
def run_rl_with_world_model():
    # Load pre-trained world model from Method 1
    world_model = DualWorldModel.load(il_model_path)
    
    # Create world model environment
    env = WorldModelEnvironment(world_model, train_videos, config)
    
    # Train RL agent using world model simulation
    agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, **ppo_config)
    agent.learn(total_timesteps=50000)
    
    # Evaluate on both simulated and real environments
    sim_rewards = evaluate_policy(agent, env)
    real_rewards = evaluate_on_real_videos(agent, test_videos)
    
    return {
        'simulated_performance': sim_rewards,
        'real_performance': real_rewards,
        'world_model_path': il_model_path
    }
```

### Phase 4: Method 3 - RL without World Model
```python
def run_rl_direct():
    # Create direct video environment (no world model)
    env = DirectVideoEnvironment(train_videos, config)
    
    # Train RL agent directly on video sequences
    agent = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, **ppo_config)
    agent.learn(total_timesteps=50000)
    
    # Evaluate on real video sequences
    real_rewards = evaluate_policy(agent, env)
    
    return {
        'real_performance': real_rewards,
        'uses_world_model': False
    }
```

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Comparison
```python
def run_comparison():
    # Run all three methods
    il_results = run_il_baseline()
    rl_wm_results = run_rl_with_world_model() 
    rl_direct_results = run_rl_direct()
    
    # Compare results
    comparison = ComprehensiveComparison()
    results = comparison.analyze_all_methods(
        il_results, rl_wm_results, rl_direct_results
    )
    
    # Generate publication-ready analysis
    comparison.generate_paper_results(results)
    
    return results
```
