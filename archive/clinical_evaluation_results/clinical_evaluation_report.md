# Clinical Evaluation Report: Dual Inference Framework

## Executive Summary

This evaluation compares single-step and receding horizon inference approaches
for surgical action prediction, with neural network-based phase recognition.

## Clinical Inference Strategies

### 1. Single-Step Inference
- **Clinical Use**: Real-time surgical guidance
- **Latency**: <100ms per prediction
- **Planning Depth**: Immediate next action only
- **Best For**: Time-critical interventions, continuous assistance

### 2. Receding Horizon Inference
- **Clinical Use**: Semi-autonomous surgical segments
- **Latency**: <1000ms for 5-step planning
- **Planning Depth**: 5 steps ahead
- **Best For**: Complex maneuvers requiring foresight

## Performance Results

### Ppo
- Single-step mAP: 0.300
- Receding horizon mAP: 0.300
- Planning benefit: +0.000 (+0.0%)

### Imitation Learning
- Single-step mAP: 0.986
- Receding horizon mAP: 0.986
- Planning benefit: +0.000 (+0.0%)

### Sac
- Single-step mAP: 0.369
- Receding horizon mAP: 0.369
- Planning benefit: +0.000 (+0.0%)

## Clinical Recommendations

- For immediate surgical guidance: Use Imitation Learning
- For semi-autonomous procedures: Use Imitation Learning with horizon=5
- Single-step inference recommended for time-critical interventions
- Receding horizon provides 5-step lookahead for surgical planning
- Phase recognition enhances both approaches with surgical context awareness

## Neural Phase Recognition

- Replaces crude phase approximation with learned neural network
- Provides surgical context awareness for both inference modes
- Enhances action prediction accuracy through phase-appropriate planning

## Clinical Integration

Both inference modes provide distinct clinical value:
1. **Single-step** for immediate surgical guidance and real-time assistance
2. **Receding horizon** for semi-autonomous procedures with surgical foresight

The choice depends on clinical context, latency requirements, and autonomy level.
