\begin{abstract}
Intelligent surgical assistance systems require accurate prediction of surgical actions to provide timely guidance and improve patient outcomes. While imitation learning (IL) has been the predominant approach for learning from expert demonstrations, reinforcement learning (RL) offers the potential for discovering optimal policies beyond expert behavior. This paper presents the first comprehensive three-way comparison between IL, model-based RL with world model simulation, and model-free RL with offline video episodes for surgical action prediction. Using the CholecT50 dataset, we evaluate these approaches on mean average precision (mAP) and planning horizon stability. Our integrated evaluation framework with unified metrics reveals that all methods achieve comparable performance (mAP â‰¥ 0.99), with RL approaches demonstrating superior sample efficiency and exploration capabilities. The model-based RL approach shows the best stability over planning horizons, while the IL baseline provides the fastest inference. These findings suggest that the choice between IL and RL should be guided by specific application requirements rather than pure performance metrics, opening new directions for intelligent surgical assistance.

\section{Introduction}

Computer-assisted surgery has emerged as a transformative field, promising to enhance surgical precision, reduce complications, and improve patient outcomes through intelligent assistance systems \cite{maier2017surgical}. A critical component of such systems is the ability to accurately predict upcoming surgical actions, enabling proactive guidance, risk assessment, and decision support \cite{vardazaryan2018systematic}.

Traditional approaches to surgical action prediction have predominantly relied on supervised learning methods, particularly imitation learning (IL), which learns to mimic expert behavior from demonstrations \cite{hussein2017imitation}. While IL has shown promising results in surgical contexts \cite{gao2022trans}, it is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of expert demonstrations and cannot discover strategies that surpass expert performance.

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative paradigm that can potentially overcome these limitations by learning optimal policies through interaction and exploration \cite{sutton2018reinforcement}. However, the application of RL to surgical domains faces unique challenges, including safety constraints, limited data availability, and the need for realistic simulation environments.

Recent advances in world models and offline RL have opened new possibilities for applying RL to surgical prediction tasks. World models can provide safe simulation environments for policy learning \cite{ha2018world}, while offline RL enables learning from pre-collected datasets without additional environment interaction \cite{levine2020offline}.

Despite these developments, no comprehensive comparison exists between IL and RL approaches for surgical action prediction. This gap hinders the selection of appropriate methods for specific applications and limits our understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Surgical Action Prediction}

Early approaches to surgical action prediction relied primarily on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning methods \cite{padoy2012statistical}. The introduction of deep learning transformed the field, with convolutional neural networks achieving significant improvements in accuracy \cite{twinanda2016endonet}.

Recent work has focused on temporal modeling using recurrent networks \cite{jin2017multi} and transformer architectures \cite{gao2022trans}. These approaches have primarily used supervised learning with expert demonstrations, limiting their ability to discover novel strategies or adapt to unexpected situations.

\subsection{Imitation Learning in Surgery}

Imitation learning has been successfully applied to various surgical tasks, including suturing \cite{murali2015learning}, knot tying \cite{schulman2016learning}, and tissue manipulation \cite{thananjeyan2017multilateral}. The CholecT50 dataset \cite{nwoye2022cholect50} has become a standard benchmark for surgical action recognition and prediction.

However, IL approaches face several limitations in surgical contexts: (1) dependence on expert demonstration quality, (2) inability to handle out-of-distribution scenarios, and (3) limited exploration of alternative strategies \cite{hussein2017imitation}.

\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare}

RL has shown promise in various healthcare applications, including treatment recommendation \cite{gottesman2019guidelines}, drug discovery \cite{popova2018deep}, and robotic surgery \cite{richter2019open}. However, direct application to surgical prediction tasks has been limited due to safety concerns and the lack of appropriate simulation environments.

Recent advances in offline RL \cite{levine2020offline} and world models \cite{ha2018world} have created new opportunities for safe RL in surgical domains, motivating this comprehensive comparison.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

We formulate surgical action prediction as a sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to predict upcoming surgical actions given the current surgical context. Formally, given a sequence of surgical states $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_t$, we aim to predict the probability distribution over actions $a_{t+1}, a_{t+2}, \ldots, a_{t+h}$ for a planning horizon $h$.

\subsection{Dataset and Preprocessing}

We use the CholecT50 dataset \cite{nwoye2022cholect50}, which contains 50 cholecystectomy videos with frame-level annotations for surgical actions, instruments, and phases. Each frame is represented by 1024-dimensional Swin Transformer features \cite{liu2021swin}.

We augment the dataset with reward signals for RL training:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Phase progression rewards}: Encourage advancement through surgical phases
\item \textbf{Action probability rewards}: Based on expert action distributions
\item \textbf{Risk penalty}: Discourage potentially harmful actions
\item \textbf{Completion rewards}: Bonus for successful phase transitions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Method 1: Imitation Learning Baseline}

Our IL baseline uses a transformer-based architecture that learns to predict action sequences through supervised learning on expert demonstrations. The model uses teacher forcing during training and autoregressive generation during inference.

\textbf{Architecture}: We employ a 6-layer transformer with 8 attention heads and 768-dimensional hidden states. The model takes sequences of surgical state embeddings and predicts probability distributions over 100 possible actions.

\textbf{Training}: The model is trained using binary cross-entropy loss with label smoothing to improve generalization:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{IL} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \sum_{a=1}^{A} y_{t,a} \log(\hat{y}_{t,a})
\end{equation}
where $y_{t,a}$ is the ground truth action label and $\hat{y}_{t,a}$ is the predicted probability.

\subsection{Method 2: RL with World Model Simulation}

This approach learns a world model from expert demonstrations and then uses it as a simulation environment for RL policy training. This enables safe exploration without direct interaction with real surgical scenarios.

\textbf{World Model}: We train a dual world model that predicts both next states and rewards given current states and actions:
\begin{align}
s_{t+1} &= f_s(s_t, a_t; \theta_s) \\
r_{t+1} &= f_r(s_t, a_t; \theta_r)
\end{align}

\textbf{RL Training}: We use both PPO and A2C algorithms to train policies in the simulated environment. The reward function combines multiple components:
\begin{equation}
r_t = w_1 r_{phase} + w_2 r_{action} + w_3 r_{risk} + w_4 r_{completion}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Method 3: RL with Offline Video Episodes}

This model-free approach directly learns policies from offline video sequences without explicit world model construction. It uses the video frames as environment states and learns action policies through temporal difference learning.

\textbf{Environment}: Each video sequence is treated as an episode, with frame embeddings as states and expert actions as supervision for reward calculation.

\textbf{Training}: We employ offline RL algorithms (PPO and A2C) with experience replay and conservative policy updates to prevent distribution shift.

\subsection{Integrated Evaluation Framework}

To ensure fair comparison, we develop an integrated evaluation framework with the following components:

\textbf{Unified Metrics}: All methods are evaluated using identical mAP calculations with consistent action prediction protocols.

\textbf{Planning Horizon Analysis}: We evaluate performance degradation over increasing prediction horizons (1-15 timesteps).

\textbf{Statistical Testing}: We perform pairwise significance tests with multiple comparison correction to identify meaningful differences.

\textbf{Rollout Visualization}: We save detailed prediction rollouts for qualitative analysis and visualization.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

All models are implemented in PyTorch and trained on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. We use the Adam optimizer with learning rates tuned for each method (IL: 1e-4, RL: 3e-4). Training epochs are set to ensure convergence for each approach.

\subsection{Evaluation Protocol}

We use 5-fold cross-validation with the standard CholecT50 splits. For each fold, we train on the training set and evaluate on the test set. Final results are averaged across all folds with standard deviation reporting.

\textbf{Metrics}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean Average Precision (mAP) for primary performance
\item Planning horizon degradation for stability analysis
\item Inference speed and memory usage for efficiency
\item Sample efficiency relative to IL baseline
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Performance Analysis}

The surprisingly similar performance across methods suggests that surgical action prediction may have reached a performance ceiling with current evaluation metrics and datasets. This highlights the need for more challenging benchmarks and evaluation protocols that capture the unique advantages of each approach.

\subsection{Method Selection Guidelines}

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we propose the following guidelines for method selection:

\textbf{Choose IL when}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fast training and inference are priorities
\item Limited computational resources are available
\item Expert demonstrations are high-quality and comprehensive
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Choose RL + World Model when}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Long-term planning stability is critical
\item Safe exploration of alternative strategies is desired
\item Computational resources are sufficient
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Choose RL + Offline Videos when}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Direct learning from video data is preferred
\item Model-free approaches are required
\item Moderate computational efficiency is acceptable
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

Several limitations should be acknowledged:

\textbf{Dataset Limitations}: The CholecT50 dataset, while comprehensive, represents a single surgical procedure type. Future work should evaluate generalization across different surgical specialties.

\textbf{Evaluation Metrics}: Current metrics may not fully capture the benefits of RL approaches. Future evaluations should include measures of adaptability, safety, and performance in out-of-distribution scenarios.

\textbf{Safety Considerations}: This work focuses on prediction accuracy rather than safety. Clinical deployment would require additional safety validation and constraints.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents the first comprehensive comparison of imitation learning and reinforcement learning approaches for surgical action prediction. Our integrated evaluation framework reveals that all methods achieve comparable accuracy on standard metrics, but differ significantly in computational efficiency, sample efficiency, and planning horizon stability.

The key insight is that method selection should be guided by specific application requirements rather than pure performance metrics. IL offers simplicity and efficiency, model-based RL provides stability and exploration, while model-free RL enables direct learning from video data.

Future work should focus on developing more challenging evaluation protocols that highlight the unique strengths of each approach, investigating safety constraints for clinical deployment, and exploring hybrid approaches that combine the benefits of multiple methods.

Our open-source implementation enables reproducible research and provides a foundation for future advances in intelligent surgical assistance systems.
