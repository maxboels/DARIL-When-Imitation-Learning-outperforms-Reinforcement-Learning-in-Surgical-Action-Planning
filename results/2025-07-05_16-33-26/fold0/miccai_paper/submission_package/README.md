## Key Contributions
1. First systematic IL vs RL comparison for surgical planning
2. Important negative result: when RL doesn't help in expert domains  
3. Comprehensive evaluation framework for temporal planning
4. Domain insights for surgical AI development

## Results Summary

- Planning degradation: 47.1% (1s) to 29.1% (10s)
- RL approaches: Failed to improve upon IL baseline
- Key insight: Expert domains favor well-optimized IL
