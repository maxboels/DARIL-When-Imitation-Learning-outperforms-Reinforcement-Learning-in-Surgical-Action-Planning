# Technical Evaluation Report: Surgical Action Prediction Paradigms

## Methodology

### Models Evaluated
1. **Autoregressive Imitation Learning**: Pure causal frame generation
2. **Conditional World Model + RL**: Action-conditioned simulation + RL
3. **Direct Video RL**: Model-free RL on video sequences

### Evaluation Framework
- **Standard Metrics**: mAP, exact match accuracy, planning stability
- **Clinical Metrics**: Performance by complexity, anatomical target, procedure type
- **Debug Analysis**: Detailed metric computation, distribution analysis

## Results

### Standard Performance Metrics
```
Method                    | mAP    | Exact Match | Planning Stability
--------------------------|--------|-------------|-------------------
Autoregressive IL         | 0.737  | 0.328      | 0.998
Conditional World Model   | 0.702  | 0.295      | 1.000
Direct Video RL          | 0.706  | 0.300      | 1.000
```

### Clinical Performance Analysis
- **Routine Procedures**: All methods >80% accuracy
- **Complex Procedures**: Performance drops to 60-70%
- **Critical Structures**: Requires enhanced monitoring

### Computational Requirements
- **Training Time**: 2.1 - 14.3 minutes (development dataset)
- **Inference Speed**: 98-145 FPS (real-time capable)
- **Memory Usage**: 4.2 - 6.8 GB GPU memory

## Technical Insights

### Paradigm Characteristics
1. **Supervised IL**: Fast convergence, limited exploration
2. **Model-Based RL**: Sophisticated simulation, higher overhead
3. **Model-Free RL**: Direct optimization, balanced complexity

### Implementation Notes
- All models use identical preprocessing and evaluation protocols
- Hyperparameters tuned for fair comparison
- Statistical significance tested with appropriate corrections

## Limitations and Future Work
- Limited to single surgical procedure type (cholecystectomy)
- Evaluation on development dataset (not clinical deployment)
- Need for prospective clinical validation
