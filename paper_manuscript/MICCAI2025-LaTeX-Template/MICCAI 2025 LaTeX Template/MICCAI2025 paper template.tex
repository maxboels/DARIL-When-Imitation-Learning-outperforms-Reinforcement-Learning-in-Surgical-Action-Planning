\section{Important Messages to MICCAI Authors}

This is a modified version of Springer's LNCS template suitable for anonymized MICCAI 2025 main conference submissions. The author section has already been anonymized for you.  You cannot remove the author section to gain extra writing space.  You must not remove the abstract and the keyword sections in your submission.

To avoid an accidental anonymity breach, you are not required to include the acknowledgments and the Disclosure of Interest sections for the initial submission phase.  If your paper is accepted, you must reinsert these sections to your final paper. 

To avoid desk rejection of your paper, you are encouraged to read "Avoiding Desk Rejection" by the MICCAI submission platform manager.  A few important rules are summarized below for your reference:  
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do not modify or remove the provided anonymized author section.
    \item Do not remove the abstract and keyword sections to gain extra writing space. Authors must provide at least one keyword.
    \item Inline figures (wrapping text around a figure) are not allowed.
    \item Authors are not allowed to change the default margins, font size, font type, and document style.  If you are using any additional packages, it is the author's responsibility that any additional packages do not inherently change the document's layout.
    \item It is prohibited to use commands such as \verb|\vspace| and \verb|\hspace| to reduce the pre-set white space in the document.
    \item Please make sure your figures and tables do not span into the margins.
    \item If you have tables, the smallest font size allowed is 8pt.
    \item Please ensure your paper is properly anonymized.  Refer to your previously published paper in the third person.  Data collection location and private dataset should be masked.
    \item Your paper must not exceed the page limit.  You can have 8 pages of the main content (text (including paper title, author section, abstract, keyword section), figures and tables, and conclusion) plus up to 2 pages of references.  The reference section does not need to start on a new page.  If you include the acknowledgments and the Disclosure of Interest sections, these two sections are considered part of the main content.
    \item If you submit supplementary material, please note that reviewers are encouraged but not required to read it.  The main paper should be self-contained.  *NEW* Supplementary materials are limited to multimedia content (e.g., videos) as warranted by the technical application (e.g. robotics, surgery, â€¦.). These files should not display any proofs, analysis, or additional results, and should not show any identification markers either. Violation of this guideline will lead to desk rejection. PDF files may NOT be submitted as supplementary materials in 2025 unless authors are citing a paper that has not yet been published.  In such a case, authors are required to submit an anonymized version of the cited paper.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Section}
\subsection{A Subsection Sample}
Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is
not indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure,
equation etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

\subsubsection{Sample Heading (Third Level)} Only two levels of
headings should be numbered. Lower level headings remain unnumbered;
they are formatted as run-in headings.

\paragraph{Sample Heading (Fourth Level)}
The contribution should contain no more than four levels of
headings. Table~\ref{tab1} gives a summary of all heading levels.

\begin{table}
\caption{Table captions should be placed above the
tables.}\label{tab1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
\hline
Heading level &  Example & Font size and style\\
\hline
Title (centered) &  {\Large\bfseries Lecture Notes} & 14 point, bold\\
1st-level heading &  {\large\bfseries 1 Introduction} & 12 point, bold\\
2nd-level heading & {\bfseries 2.1 Printing Area} & 10 point, bold\\
3rd-level heading & {\bfseries Run-in Heading in Bold.} Text follows & 10 point, bold\\
4th-level heading & {\itshape Lowest Level Heading.} Text follows & 10 point, italic\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


\noindent Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate
line.
\begin{equation}
x + y = z
\end{equation}
Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art diagrams and
schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead (see
Fig.~\ref{fig1}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig1.eps}
\caption{A figure caption is always placed below the illustration.
Please note that short captions are centered, while long ones are
justified by the macro package automatically.} \label{fig1}
\end{figure}

\begin{theorem}
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while
the following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas,
propositions, and corollaries are styled the same way.
\end{theorem}
%
% the environments 'definition', 'lemma', 'proposition', 'corollary',
% 'remark', and 'example' are defined in the LLNCS documentclass as well.
%
\begin{proof}
Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font.
\end{proof}
For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets
and consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides
a sample reference list with entries for journal
articles~\cite{ref_article1}, an LNCS chapter~\cite{ref_lncs1}, a
book~\cite{ref_book1}, proceedings without editors~\cite{ref_proc1},
and a homepage~\cite{ref_url1}. Multiple citations are grouped
\cite{ref_article1,ref_lncs1,ref_book1},
\cite{ref_article1,ref_book1,ref_proc1,ref_url1}.

\begin{comment}  %% removed for anonymized MICCAI 2025 submission.
    
    % The following acknowledgement and disclaimer sections should be removed for the double-blind review process.  
    % If and when your paper is accepted, reinsert the acknowledgement and the disclaimer clause in your final camera-ready version.

\begin{credits}
\subsubsection{\ackname} A bold run-in heading in small font size at the end of the paper is
used for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded
by X (grant number Y).

\subsubsection{\discintname}
It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to specifically
state that the authors have no competing interests. Please place the
statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size beneath the
(optional) acknowledgments\footnote{If EquinOCS, our proceedings submission
system, is used, then the disclaimer can be provided directly in the system.},
for example: The authors have no competing interests to declare that are
relevant to the content of this article. Or: Author A has received research
grants from Company W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from
Company X and owns stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.
