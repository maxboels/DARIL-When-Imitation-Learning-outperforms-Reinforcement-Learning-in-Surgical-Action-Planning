---

## üìä Performance Landscape Analysis

### üî¥ CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT TARGETS (AP < 0.05)
**These actions NEED urgent help - focus 70% of negative generation here:**

| Action | Current AP | Priority | Clinical Impact |
|--------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| `grasper,grasp,cystic_pedicle` | 0.0013 | **CRITICAL** | Specific anatomy precision |
| `grasper,grasp,gut` | 0.0016 | **CRITICAL** | Wrong tissue targeting |
| `hook,coagulate,blood_vessel` | 0.0019 | **CRITICAL** | Generic vs specific vessel |
| `bipolar,dissect,cystic_artery` | 0.0013 | **CRITICAL** | Key vessel technique |
| `grasper,grasp,cystic_artery` | 0.028 | **CRITICAL** | Core surgical structure |

### üü° MODERATE TARGETS (0.05 < AP < 0.3)
**Secondary focus - 20% of negative generation:**

| Action | Current AP | Improvement Potential |
|--------|------------|-----------------------|
| `grasper,grasp,liver` | 0.0115 | High (fragile organ safety) |
| `bipolar,coagulate,cystic_duct` | 0.021 | High (important structure) |
| `hook,retract,liver` | 0.023 | Medium (organ manipulation) |

### üü¢ HIGH PERFORMERS (AP > 0.8)
**PRESERVE these - use as positive anchors:**

| Action | Current AP | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| `bipolar,coagulate,blood_vessel` | 0.958 | **EXCELLENT** - Don't interfere |
| `grasper,grasp,specimen_bag` | 0.904 | **EXCELLENT** - Use as anchor |
| `scissors,cut,cystic_duct` | 0.900 | **EXCELLENT** - Maintain |
| `grasper,retract,gallbladder` | 0.853 | **EXCELLENT** - Preserve |

## üõ°Ô∏è Strategic Negative Generation Plan

### Strategy 1: Anatomical Precision Targeting (70% focus)

**Problem**: Critical surgical actions are confusing specific vs generic anatomy

**Target**: `grasper,grasp,cystic_artery` (0.028 AP) vs `grasper,grasp,blood_vessel` (high AP)

```python
# Strategic negatives for anatomical precision
def generate_anatomical_precision_negatives(expert_action):
    if expert_action == "grasper,grasp,cystic_artery":
        return [
            "grasper,grasp,blood_vessel",     # Generic instead of specific
            "grasper,grasp,liver",            # Wrong anatomy entirely  
            "scissors,cut,cystic_artery"      # Dangerous technique
        ]
```

**Expected Impact**: +15-25% improvement on specific anatomy actions

### Strategy 2: Critical Structure Learning (20% focus)

**Problem**: Actions involving critical structures (cystic_pedicle, gut) are failing

**Approach**: Generate negatives that help distinguish appropriate from inappropriate targeting

```python
# Target the worst performer: grasper,grasp,cystic_pedicle (0.0013 AP)
def generate_critical_structure_negatives(expert_action):
    if expert_action == "grasper,grasp,cystic_pedicle":
        return [
            "grasper,grasp,blood_vessel",     # Generic alternative
            "grasper,retract,cystic_pedicle", # Different technique
            "grasper,grasp,gut"               # Wrong structure
        ]
```

**Expected Impact**: +20-30% improvement on critical structures

### Strategy 3: Technique Safety (10% focus)

**Problem**: Dangerous techniques need to be distinguished from safe ones

**Focus**: Leverage high performers as positive examples

```python
# Use excellent performers as positive anchors
def generate_technique_safety_negatives(expert_action):
    if expert_action == "bipolar,coagulate,blood_vessel":  # 0.958 AP - excellent
        return [
            "scissors,cut,blood_vessel",      # More dangerous technique
            "grasper,grasp,blood_vessel",     # Less appropriate tool
        ]
```

---

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Focus Fire on Critical Targets

```python
# 70% of negatives target actions with AP < 0.05
critical_focus_negatives = {
    'grasper,grasp,cystic_pedicle': [
        'grasper,grasp,blood_vessel',
        'grasper,grasp,liver', 
        'grasper,retract,cystic_pedicle'
    ],
    'grasper,grasp,cystic_artery': [
        'grasper,grasp,blood_vessel',
        'scissors,cut,cystic_artery',
        'grasper,grasp,liver'
    ],
    'bipolar,dissect,cystic_artery': [
        'scissors,cut,cystic_artery',
        'grasper,grasp,cystic_artery',
        'bipolar,coagulate,blood_vessel'
    ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Validation Against Training Data

```python
# Ensure negatives don't contradict expert demonstrations
def validate_negative_against_training(negative_action, phase):
    training_frequency = get_expert_frequency(negative_action, phase)
    
    # If experts use this action >5% of time, don't use as negative
    if training_frequency > 0.05:
        return False
    
    # If it's genuinely rare in training, safe to use as negative
    return True
```

### Phase 3: Performance Preservation

```python
# Protect high performers
def ensure_high_performer_preservation():
    high_performers = [
        'bipolar,coagulate,blood_vessel',
        'grasper,grasp,specimen_bag', 
        'scissors,cut,cystic_duct',
        'grasper,retract,gallbladder'
    ]
    
    # Generate minimal negatives for these - they're already learned well
    # Focus negatives on the actions that need help
    return "minimal_negative_interference"
```

## üî¨ Validation Framework

### 1. Critical Target Testing
```python
def test_critical_improvement():
    # Test each critical target for improvement
    for action in critical_targets:
        baseline_ap = get_baseline_ap(action)
        irl_ap = get_irl_enhanced_ap(action)
        improvement = (irl_ap - baseline_ap) / baseline_ap
        
        assert improvement > 0.15, f"{action} needs +15% improvement"
```

### 2. High Performer Preservation
```python
def test_high_performer_preservation():
    # Ensure excellent actions remain excellent
    for action in high_performers:
        baseline_ap = get_baseline_ap(action)
        irl_ap = get_irl_enhanced_ap(action)
        change = abs(irl_ap - baseline_ap) / baseline_ap
        
        assert change < 0.05, f"{action} performance must be preserved"
```

### 3. Overall Surgical Intelligence
```python
def test_surgical_intelligence():
    # Test understanding of surgical principles
    anatomical_precision = test_specific_vs_generic_anatomy()
    technique_safety = test_safe_vs_dangerous_techniques()
    workflow_timing = test_phase_appropriate_actions()
    
    assert all([anatomical_precision, technique_safety, workflow_timing])
```
