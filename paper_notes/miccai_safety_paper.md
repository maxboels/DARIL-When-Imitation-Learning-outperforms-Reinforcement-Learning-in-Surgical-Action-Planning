### **Core Research Question**
**"Can Inverse Reinforcement Learning provide safety guardrails that prevent dangerous surgical decisions while preserving expert-level performance?"**

### **Value Proposition**
- **Primary**: Clinical safety through principled learning of surgical safety constraints
- **Secondary**: Performance preservation without degradation
- **Technical**: First IRL safety framework for surgical domain

## üéØ **Abstract Structure**

### **Background**
Surgical AI systems face a fundamental constraint: they must learn safe decision-making without the trial-and-error exploration that characterizes traditional reinforcement learning. While imitation learning (IL) from expert demonstrations achieves strong performance on surgical action prediction, it only learns from positive examples and cannot capture the safety boundaries that expert surgeons intuitively understand.

### **Problem Statement**
Current surgical AI approaches lack principled mechanisms for:
1. Learning what NOT to do from expert demonstrations
2. Understanding why certain actions are dangerous in specific contexts
3. Providing safety guardrails that prevent clinically inappropriate decisions
4. Maintaining expert-level performance while adding safety constraints

### **Method**
We propose IRL-based safety guardrails that learn surgical safety principles from expert demonstrations through strategic negative generation. Our approach uses performance-targeted negative examples that represent realistic clinical mistakes, enabling the system to understand surgical safety boundaries without requiring dangerous real-world exploration. The framework combines curriculum-based negative generation with conservative policy adjustment to preserve baseline performance while learning contextual appropriateness.

### **Results**
Our approach demonstrates surgical safety intelligence across multiple dimensions: anatomical safety (X% preference for specific over generic targets), technique safety (Y% preference for safe over dangerous methods), and temporal appropriateness (Z% preference for phase-appropriate actions), while maintaining IL baseline performance within ¬±0.5% mAP.

### **Conclusion**
This work introduces the first IRL safety framework for surgical AI, providing principled safety guardrails that learn from expert demonstrations without performance degradation. The approach addresses critical clinical deployment concerns by ensuring AI systems understand not just what to do, but what not to do in surgical contexts.

## üî¨ **Methods Section**

### **1. Safety-Aware Negative Generation Framework**

#### **1.1 Performance-Targeted Safety Negatives**
Our negative generation strategy combines clinical safety motivation with strategic performance targeting:

```
Strategy Distribution:
- 70% Critical targets (AP < 0.05): Maximum impact on difficult actions
- 20% Moderate targets (0.05-0.3): Secondary improvement focus  
- 10% General safety: Overall surgical principle learning
- 0% High performers (AP > 0.8): Preserve existing excellence
```

#### **1.2 Clinical Safety Categories**

**Anatomical Safety**: Specific vs generic structure targeting
- Expert: `grasper,grasp,cystic_pedicle` (specific vessel)
- Negative: `grasper,grasp,blood_vessel` (generic vessel)
- Safety Rationale: Anatomical precision prevents injury

**Technique Safety**: Appropriate vs dangerous surgical techniques  
- Expert: `bipolar,coagulate,cystic_artery` (safe coagulation)
- Negative: `scissors,cut,cystic_artery` (dangerous cutting)
- Safety Rationale: Prevent uncontrolled bleeding

**Temporal Safety**: Phase-appropriate vs inappropriate actions
- Expert: `clipper,clip,cystic_artery` in clipping phase
- Negative: `clipper,clip,cystic_artery` in packaging phase  
- Safety Rationale: Surgical workflow intelligence

#### **1.3 Expert Demonstration Validation**
```python
def validate_negatives_against_expert_data(negatives, threshold=0.05):
    """
    Ensure negatives don't contradict expert demonstrations
    Filter negatives appearing >5% in training data
    """
    validated_negatives = []
    for negative in negatives:
        expert_frequency = get_training_frequency(negative)
        if expert_frequency < threshold:
            validated_negatives.append(negative)
    return validated_negatives
```

### **2. Conservative IRL Training Protocol**

#### **2.1 Performance-Preserving Policy Adjustment**
```python
# Ultra-conservative approach to maintain baseline performance
final_prediction = Œ± * il_baseline + (1-Œ±) * irl_adjustment

where Œ± = 0.995  # 99.5% baseline preservation
```

#### **2.2 Reward Function Design**
```python
def compute_safety_aware_reward(state, action, context):
    """
    Multi-component reward emphasizing safety principles
    """
    anatomical_reward = evaluate_anatomical_appropriateness(action, context)
    technique_reward = evaluate_technique_safety(action, state)  
    temporal_reward = evaluate_phase_appropriateness(action, context.phase)
    
    total_reward = (anatomical_reward + technique_reward + temporal_reward) / 3
    return total_reward
```

#### **2.3 Training Safeguards**
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of IL baseline preservation
- **Safety Validation**: Regular testing of safety principle learning
- **Expert Consistency**: Validation against expert demonstration patterns

### **3. Safety Intelligence Evaluation Framework**

#### **3.1 Contextual Understanding Tests**
```python
safety_evaluation = {
    'anatomical_safety': test_specific_vs_generic_targeting(),
    'technique_safety': test_safe_vs_dangerous_methods(),
    'temporal_appropriateness': test_phase_appropriate_actions(),
    'expert_alignment': test_expert_vs_dangerous_preferences()
}
```

#### **3.2 Performance Preservation Metrics**
- **Overall mAP**: Maintain within ¬±1% of IL baseline
- **Critical Action Performance**: Track improvement on AP < 0.05 actions
- **High Performer Stability**: Preserve AP > 0.8 action performance

#### **3.3 Clinical Relevance Assessment**
- **Safety Preference Score**: % preference for expert over dangerous alternatives
- **Contextual Understanding**: Ability to reject inappropriate actions
- **Surgical Intelligence**: Demonstration of medical knowledge beyond imitation
