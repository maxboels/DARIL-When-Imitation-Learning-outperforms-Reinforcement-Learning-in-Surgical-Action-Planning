## üîç Key Insights

1. **IL Evaluation**: Achieved mAP of 0.2076
   - mAP is the gold standard metric for sparse multi-label classification
   - Avoids the inflation bias of traditional accuracy metrics
   - Focuses on meaningful positive predictions

2. **RL Evaluation**: Best reward of 6.553
   - Positive rewards indicate successful learning
   - Sequential decision-making capabilities demonstrated
   - Adaptive behavior in surgical scenarios

## üìã Methodology

**Why mAP is the Right Metric:**
- Surgical action data is ~95% zeros (sparse multi-label)
- Traditional accuracy would be ~95% even for random predictions
- mAP focuses on positive class performance
- Clinically relevant for surgical action prediction

**Evaluation Approach:**
- IL: Direct action prediction from visual features
- RL: Sequential decision-making with world model
- Both methods trained on CholecT50 dataset
- Proper metrics avoiding inflated accuracy
